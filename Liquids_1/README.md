# Liquids FLIP simulation and rendering with Mantra, Karma CPU and Karma XPU

Mantra and Karma CPU renderers are in 'out', video was rendered with Karma XPU through 'stage' using MaterialX for water. Results with Mantra, Karma CPU and Karma XPU differ a lot -- see EXRs in 'render'.

Made in Houdini 19.5.615. Took me about 4 hours to render the scene on Ryzen 5900X + GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. Mantra rendering time would be about 3 times longer.

This is an 'Applied Houdini' (https://www.appliedhoudini.com/) lesson.
